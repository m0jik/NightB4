## Design Philosophy

I built this program because I wanted a program that can structure my day, but not in an hour-to-hour, minute-to-minute way that tends to leave me burnt out. With this program, I can plan out my mornings, afternoons, and evenings, with a section for my day goals, which are goals that will either take throughout the day to complete, or goals that are relatively low priority, so I can just do them at any point during the day.

## How I Use It

I use this app every night, where I plan my goals for tomorrow the night before, and write each goal in whichever one of the four sections that correspond to the time of day I want the goal accomplished (hence the name). I do this so I don't have to go throughout the day trying to remember what I need to do, and by making this a part of my nightly routine, I use the quiet hours to contemplate on the things I really need to do.

## Getting Started

Esnure you have the proper dependencies installed in order to run the program. Provided you have everything, the fat jar file should be all you need in order to start using this program.

## Compatibility

This was built in Ubuntu using Maven, so it natively runs in Ubuntu. It can also be run using WSL, if you choose to do all of this on Windows. I have not yet found a way to get this program running on MacOS.

## Known Issues

The "Tomorrow's Goals" section seems to lose its goals sometimes after a full system shutdown (not just an app closure). I have not yet encountered this issue with the "Today's Goals" section.
